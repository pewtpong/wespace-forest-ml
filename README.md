# WeSpace tree detection
This repository contains machine learning materials for the Wespace Forest project. Typically, I work on Google Colab.
* FYI: the credentials displayed in this repository are not functional or valid.

All of the data in this repository has been labeled using the Makesense.ai platform and converted to annotations using the 'convert_2_deepforest_format.ipynb' script.

# Moving forward
the next step is to automate the detection of trees and save the resulting data to a database. This will be achieved by creating an API that can receive start (latitude, longitude) and end (latitude, longitude) coordinates.
