# WeSpace tree detection
This repository contains machine learning materials for the Wespace Forest project. Typically, I work on Google Colab.

**FYI: the credentials displayed in this repository are not functional or valid.**
All of the data in this repository has been labeled using the Makesense.ai platform and converted to annotations using the 'convert_2_deepforest_format.ipynb' script.

* forest_poc.ipynb contains a comprehensive set of functionalities for this project. These functionalities include image download from Google Maps, calculation of the next latitude and longitude for downloading images that are adjacent to the previous image horizontally and vertically, training a deepforest machine learning model, and generating a CSV file from the predictions.

> It's important to note that while forest_poc.ipynb may contain all the necessary code for this project, it's always a good idea to review and understand the code before using it to ensure that it's suitable for your particular use case. Additionally, it's crucial to have the appropriate permissions and authorizations when downloading images from third-party sources like Google Maps.

* forest_data_augmentation.ipynb contains code for automating the data augmentation process. As the project has limited time to label data, data augmentation can be a useful technique for increasing the amount of training data and improving the model's performance.

> However, it's important to note that data augmentation techniques should be chosen carefully and applied appropriately based on the nature of the data and the problem being solved. Additionally, it's essential to have a balanced and representative training dataset to ensure the model's generalization ability.
It's recommended to review and understand the code in forest_data_augmentation.ipynb before using it to ensure that it's suitable for your particular use case and meets your quality standards.

* convert_2_deepforest_format.ipynb contains code for converting labeled data that has been generated by the makesense.ai labeling tool into a format that is compatible with the deepforest model for training.

> t's important to note that the quality of the labeled data is crucial for the model's performance, and it's recommended to review and verify the accuracy of the labeled data before using it for training. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure that the converted data is in the appropriate format and compatible with the deepforest model's requirements.

# Moving forward
the next step is to automate the detection of trees and save the resulting data to a database. This will be achieved by creating an API that can receive start (latitude, longitude) and end (latitude, longitude) coordinates.
